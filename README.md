## Hello, I'm Christopher Burie

I am a computer science student at **Lake Superior State University**, and I am passionate about writing clean, maintainble code.

I enjoy learning deeply and asking thought-provoking questions.

During breaks from college, I work as an application development intern at MJ Electric where I am gaining experience with:
- ASP.NET Core
- MS SQL Server
- EF Core
- Kendo UI Library
- Frontend Development
- Code Refactoring for Maintability

In my free time, my favorite places to be are with my family or outside enjoying the beautiful nature in Michigan's Upper Peninsula: snowshoeing, hiking, snowmobiling, or other such activities.

Professionally, I strive to continually learn new skills and best practices to ensure I can continously improve the quality of my software solutions.

Personally, my greatest goal in life is to continuously grow as a follower of Jesus, striving to live more like Him despite my flaws.
